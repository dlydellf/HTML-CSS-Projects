This repo stores the HTML & CSS projects I've completed as I progressed through The Tech Academy's curriculum

## Projects:
- [x] Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy")
- [x] One-Page Website

### Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy"):
An example of a fictitious business's home page:
- Created with numerous Bootstrap4 components, including:
  - a navbar, a jumbotron, two dropdown menus, two contact forms, & several cards of varying types, layouts, & styles
- HTML has been *thoroughly* commented to make navigating among its different elements easier

### One-Page Website:
A (humorous!) example of a one-paged website that offers alternative home security options:
- Styled with CSS, it includes:
  - a sticky navbar,
  - three modals/lightboxes (controllable via thumbnails or Next/Previous buttons),
  - relevant images (with "alt" descriptions), and...
  - a contact form (with related options organized into groups)
  - **Humor!**   50/50 chance it'll brighten your day!! :)

### Space Station Website:
An example of a fictional Space Travel Company's home page:
- Styled with CSS and containing a navbar, several image containers, & a contact form
