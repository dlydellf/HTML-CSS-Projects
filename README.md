# HTML-CSS-Projects
A new repo to store my Tech Academy coding projects.

This repository will hold the HTML & CSS projects I've completed as I progress through The Tech Academy's curriculum, beginning from their "HTML & CSS Course" onward.

## Projects:
[x] Space Station Website
[x] Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy")
[x] One-Page Website

### Space Station Website:
An example of a fictional Space Travel Company's home page, styled with CSS and containing a navbar, image containers, and a contact form.

### Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy"):
An example of a fictitious ("The Pool Academy") business's home page, created with Bootstrap4 and containing numerous components, including a navbar, two dropdown menus, a jumbotron, two contact forms, and several cards of varying types, layouts, & styles; HTML has been commented thoroughly to make navigating to different elements easier.

### One-Page Website:
A humorous example of a one-paged website that offers alternative home security options.  Styled with CSS, it includes a sticky navbar, three modals/lightboxes (controllable via thumbnails or Next/Previous buttons), relevant images with "alt" descriptions, and a contact form with related options organized into groups.
