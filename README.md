# HTML-CSS-Projects
A new repo to store my Tech Academy coding projects.

This repository will hold the HTML & CSS projects I've completed as I progress through The Tech Academy's curriculum, beginning from their "HTML & CSS Course" onward.

## Projects:
- [x] Space Station Website
- [x] Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy")
- [x] One-Page Website

### Space Station Website:
An example of a fictional Space Travel Company's home page:
- Styled with CSS and containing a navbar, several image containers, and a contact form.

### Bootstrap Website ("The Pool Academy"):
An example of a fictitious business's home page:
- Created with Bootstrap4 and containing numerous components, including:
  - a navbar, a jumbotron, two dropdown menus, two contact forms, and several cards of varying types, layouts, & styles
- HTML has been *thoroughly* commented to make navigating among its different elements easier.

### One-Page Website:
A (humorous!) example of a one-paged website that offers alternative home security options:
- Styled with CSS, it includes:
  - a sticky navbar,
  - three modals/lightboxes (controllable via thumbnails or Next/Previous buttons),
  - relevant images (with "alt" descriptions), and
  - a contact form (with related options organized into groups)
