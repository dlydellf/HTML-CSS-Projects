# HTML-CSS-Projects
A new repo to store my Tech Academy coding projects.

This repository will hold the HTML & CSS projects I've completed as I progress through The Tech Academy's curriculum, beginning from their "HTML & CSS Course" onward.

## Projects
- Space Station Website
- Pool Academy Website

### Space Station Website
An example of a fictional Space Travel Company's home page, styled with CSS and containing a navbar, image containers, and a contact form.

### Pool Academy Website
An example of a fictious Pool Academy's home page, created with Bootstrap4 and containing several components, including a navbar, contact form, dropdowns, jumbotron, and several cards of varying layouts.
