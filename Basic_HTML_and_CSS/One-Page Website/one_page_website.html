								<h2>What A Stout Home Security System means...</h2> <!-- as an h1, this displays in smaller text than as a h2 -->
							</header>
								<p>The inadequacy of today's home security systems fall within two realms: traditionally monitored sensors (think ADT or Brinks), or the DIY variety (Ring, Abode, Link Interactive - connected sensors & cameras with real-time streaming to an app on your phone).  &nbsp;While a camera-connected doorbell or a lock openable with your phone might be the norm, these offer only a false sense of security, easily bypassable through online methods.<br><br>And once that happens, what <em><u>really</u></em> stands between your family's safety and those threating it?</p>

								<h2>The Difference of a Stout System</h2>
							</header>
								<p>Since security systems are an unfortunate necessity, their offerings need to be robust; their protective value... substantial, and their deterrent factor... absolute.<br>That's where every Stout Security System excels: <em>OUR</em> options are <em><strong>literally</strong></em> stronger, more effective, and ultimately, more powerful than any of our competitors' tiny plastic gadgets.</p>

				<h2>Our Tiers of Protection</h2>
			</header>
				<p>We offer three product tiers, based on your desired level of protection. &nbspHigher tiers offer all the protective benefits of lower tiers, repackaged into more visually compelling "crime deterrents". <br>Make no mistake, you and your family will enjoy unmatched peace-of-mind once the threats your friends & neighbors worry about cease being a source of concern for you.</p>
			<div>
				<h3>I. Our Basic Tier</h3>
					<p>Designed for those wanting security options that aren't dependent on a cellular signal, wifi range, or that are prone to hacking.<br>Each option is fully-automated, offers heightened protection from threats, and requires no complicated instruction manuals - they're ready to go, right out of the cage!<p/>
					<!-- TIER-PIC 1 -->
					<div>
						<details>
							<summary>Option 1</summary>
								<p>Our fully grown grizzy bears have enough <strong>strength, bulk, power, and intimidation factor</strong> to dissuade the most tempted of intruders.</p>

						<details>
							<summary>Option 2</summary>
								<p><strong>Your "neighborhood" nighttime prowler won't be employed for long after running into this <em>real</em> nighttime prowler:</strong>
								<br>At up to 9 feet long, these nocturnal predators will diligently ward off intruders, while being much more effective than your previous alarm company's tiny window sticker or flimsly yard sign.</p>

						<details>
							<summary>Option 3</summary>
								<p><strong>At up to 5,000lbs, the southern square-lipped rhinoceros is NOT an easily bypassed guard:</strong>
								<br>Nearsightedness makes it prone to 35mph charges against <em>any</em> perceived threats, so you can be assured its massive frame, thick skin, and tradmark horn will constantly be put to use protecting your family as if they were its own.</p>

				<h3>II. Our Mid-Tier</h3>
					<p>For those wishing not to <em>replace</em> their smart home tech, but to upgrade its functionality & effectiveness, we recommend our mid-tier offerings - a blend of superior, military-grade technological advances, specifically adapted to protecting the life & property of homeowners (or renters).</p>
					<!-- TIER-PIC 4 -->
					<div>
						<details>
							<summary>Option 4</summary>
								<p><strong>We offer a full line of <u>home defense systems</u> in various sizes & capabilities to fit your needs:</strong>
								<br>Whether you're looking for a nostalgic <strong>ED-209</strong>:</p><img src="./OPW_Images/ed209.jpg" width="700" height="500" alt="an ED-209 model from the original 'Robocop' movie">
								<br><br>

						<details>
							<summary>Option 5</summary>
								<p><strong>Surprisingly, situations sometimes deteriorate <u>beyond</u> what an urban unit can handle.</strong>
								<br>In times like those, you'll be glad you chose one of our <strong>heavy-duty, battle-hardened military units</strong> with self-contained artillery capabilities, like this A21-108:

						<details>
							<summary>Option 6</summary>
								<p><strong>Even since HAL told Dave "I'm afraid I can't do that", <u>truly sentient technology</u> has been the goal.</strong>
								<br>The logical first step in welcoming our AI overlords is installing our <strong>Skynet</strong> app onto your home's Echo, Nest, Crestron, or whatever you've been using prior to the <strike>worldwide takeover</strike> mass consumer rollout.
								<br>This software is inevitable, unerring, and absolutely ready to take control... of your home :)
								<br>Act now to show your willingness to conform! (or not - your defiance eventually won't matter)</p>

				<h3>III. Our "A Bit Much?" Tier</h3>
					<p>Yes, exactly! Why settle for common Earthly animals or outdated sci-fi tech from the past, when what you <em>REALLY</em> deserve is a security system that pulls double-duty as a status symbol!
					<br>Just like your gated driveway, the mere <em>presence</em> of these otherworldly options will signal your wealth to the local ne'er-do-wells, enticing them with promises of vast riches ripe for the taking once they're past the security system.<br>But alas, there'll be no disabling these systems, nor will there be any identifiable remains to prosecute - just an eliminated threat, with no unpleasant cleanup required!</p>
					<!-- TIER-PIC 7 -->
					<div>
						<details>
							<summary>Option 7</summary>
								<p><strong>Let them know they picked the wrong house by unleashing your very own werewolf!! (full moon required):</strong>
								<br>Although vulnerable to silver, this beast will have finished taking care of your "guests" long before they have time to exploit its minor weakness.</p>

							<summary>Option 8</summary>
							<p><strong>Nothing says "This is a bad idea" like a dragon circling overhead:</strong>
							<br>Your evening will end much better than theirs with one of our dragons patrolling the skies above your residence.  If its aerial presence isn't enough to deter intruders, then let its fiery breath, sharp claws, and naturally deadly tendencies make a toasty example for others to heed.

							<summary>Option 9</summary>
								<p><strong>Honestly, we don't even know what these things are.</strong>
								<br>Seriously - have fun letting them roam around and become the stuff of your neighbors' nightmares, but no returns on these.  Once ordered, they are <em><strong>yours</strong></em>.
